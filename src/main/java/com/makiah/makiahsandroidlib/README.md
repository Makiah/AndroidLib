# My Android Lib

I find the customary way of multithreading via AsyncTasks to be a bit tedious to set up, and logging to a screen as well as a file as well as the screen to be difficult without explicitly setting it up first in a project.  This repo just streamlines this process, and I use it for my Android apps.
